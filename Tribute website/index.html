                <h2>The Father of Theoretical Physics</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Richard Feynman</b> was a Nobel-prizewinning US theoretical physicist. Famed for his brilliant
                    mind and mercurial personality, his main work was in quantum physics and particle physics, where he
                    is particularly known for the Feynman diagram, a way of depicting particle processes graphically.
                    But he was a prolific writer and thinker who also pioneered ideas in quantum computing and
                    nanotechnology. In his last years, he gained widespread public fame as a prominent and outspoken
                    member of the commission investigating the fatal Challenger Space Shuttle disaster.

                    Feynman first made a scientific name for himself as a member of the Manhattan project to build the
                    nuclear bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 at the end of the second world
                    war.

                <h3>His Discoveries</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Revolutionized the fields of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics, and received a Nobel
                        prize for his work in these fields in 1965</li>
                    <li>Feynman remade quantum electrodynamics—the theory of the interaction between light and
                        matter—and thus altered the way science understands the nature of waves and particles.</li>
                    <li>The problem-solving tools that he invented—including pictorial representations of particle
                        interactions known as Feynman diagrams—permeated many areas of theoretical physics in the second
                        half of the 20th century.</li>
                    <li>He studied physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where his undergraduate thesis
                        (1939) proposed an original and enduring approach to calculating forces in molecules. </li>
                    <li>Feynman's method calculated the probabilities of all the possible paths a particle could take in
                        going from one point to another.</li>
